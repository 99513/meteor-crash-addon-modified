# meteor-crash-addon
Add-on that includes various server crashing methods

This is more of a personal challenge to see if I can actually do it rather than a serious project.

Credit for the actual modules goes to their respective owners. I'm just implementing them into a meteor add-on

## Usage
- either build, or download the latest dev build from the [releases page](https://github.com/Wide-Cat/meteor-crash-addon/releases)
- put in mods folder along with meteor client
- run
