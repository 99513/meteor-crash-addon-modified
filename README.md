# meteor-crash-addon
Add-on that includes various server crashing methods

This is more of a personal challenge to see if I can actually do it rather than a serious project.

All credit for the actual modules goes to [Cornos](https://github.com/AriliusClient/Cornos/). I'm just implementing them into a meteor add-on

To the owner - if you want this taken down or whatever, message me at Wide_Cat#6112

## Usage
- build
- put in mods folder along with meteor client
- run
