# meteor-crash-addon
Add-on that includes various server crashing methods

This is more of a personal challenge to see if I can actually do it rather than a serious project.

All credit for the actual modules goes to their respective owners (cornos, bhack, ares). I'm just implementing them into a meteor add-on

To the owners of any repos I've taken code from - if you want this taken down or your modules removed or whatever, message me at Wide_Cat#6112

## Usage
- either build, or download the jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/Wide-Cat/meteor-crash-addon/releases/tag/0.0.1)
- put in mods folder along with meteor client
- run
